# means that Chroma’s REST API client is not yet supported in the version of the chromadb Python library you're using — it only supports local (in-process) clients, not remote servers like the one running in your Podman container.

poetry run python scripts/embed_notes.py

# In short: Chroma does not allow lists as metadata values.
# Your tags field is a list (["demo", "test", "vault-rummager"]), but Chroma only accepts flat types like:


touch scripts/query.py

poetry run python scripts/query.py "What do my notes say about second brains?"


# Add new file to the notes directory
touch notes/TSWIFT.md
# Rerun the parsing & embedding pipelines
poetry run python scripts/embed_notes.py

# Ask more qeustions
poetry run python scripts/query.py "What do my notes say about when Taylor Swift was born?"

# Add convenience wrapper to reindex
touch scripts/reindex.py
poetry run python scripts/reindex.py
# full reset and rebuild
poetry run python scripts/reindex.py --reset

# Ask more qeustions
poetry run python scripts/query.py "What do my notes say about when Taylor Swift was born?"

# 
# ❗ Problem: The Chunk Containing the Birthdate Is Buried Deep
# You’re probably retrieving 5 chunks from the middle or end of a giant file. Chroma has no idea that your birthdate sentence is more important than those other chunks — it’s just retrieving based on vector similarity.

# So even though you embedded the birthdate correctly, it’s:

# In an early chunk

# And not ranked high enough to be included in the top TOP_K results
