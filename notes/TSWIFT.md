At 14, Swift became the youngest artist signed by [Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing "Sony/ATV Music Publishing").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-37) She left RCA Records due to the label's lack of care and their "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Willman-2007-28)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-albuminfo-21) and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time.

In March 2023, Swift embarked on [the Eras Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour "The Eras Tour"), a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's [global cultural and economic impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_Eras_Tour "Impact of the Eras Tour"),[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-228) and its US leg broke the record for the [most tickets sold in a day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fastest-selling_concert_tours "List of fastest-selling concert tours").[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Dailey-2022-204) [Ticketmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster "Ticketmaster") received [public and political criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift%E2%80%93Ticketmaster_controversy "Taylor Swift–Ticketmaster controversy") for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-:8-229) The Eras Tour became [the highest-grossing tour in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_concert_tours "List of highest-grossing concert tours").[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-eras_gross-230)[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-231) [Its concert film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift:_The_Eras_Tour "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour"), released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become [the highest-grossing concert film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film#Highest-grossing_concert_films "Concert film") and was nominated for the [Golden Globe Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award "Golden Globe Award") for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-232)[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-233) A [photobook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photobook "Photobook"), _[The Eras Tour Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour_Book "The Eras Tour Book")_, was released on November 29, 2024, and sold over a million copies in its first week in the US alone.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-234)

After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-239) From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, _Midnights,_ and _The Tortured Poets Department_, significantly increasing her net worth; [Music Business Worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Business_Worldwide "Music Business Worldwide") remarked this as a "new stratosphere of global career success" for Swift.[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-240)[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-241) In 2023, she began dating the American football player [Travis Kelce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce "Travis Kelce"),[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-242) and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the [2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_iHeartRadio_Music_Awards "2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards").[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-243) Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist once again in 2024.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Spotify2023-244)[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-245)

In January 2024, [AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_deepfake_pornography_controversy "Taylor Swift deepfake pornography controversy") were posted to [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-246) In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a [stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking "Stalking") in [Gelsenkirchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen "Gelsenkirchen"), Germany,[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-247) and [three children were killed in a stabbing attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Southport_stabbing "2024 Southport stabbing") at a Swift-themed workshop in [Southport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport "Southport"), England, leading to [civil unrest in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_riots "2024 United Kingdom riots").[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-CNN-Picheta-05Aug24-248) In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an [Islamic State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State "Islamic State")-inspired [terrorist attack in the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Vienna_terrorism_plot "2024 Vienna terrorism plot").

## Artistry

### Musical styles

Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, including [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music"),[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-253) [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music"),[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-258) [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"),[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-262) [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music "Rock music"),[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-266) and [alternative music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_music "Alternative music").[[f]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-270) Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTESpencer201016%E2%80%9318-271) and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-272) She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a [country pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_pop "Country pop") singer with her first four studio albums, from _Taylor Swift_ to _Red_.[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcNutt202077Gasser2019310-273) The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, [mandolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandolin "Mandolin"), [fiddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddle "Fiddle"), and a slight vocal [twang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twang "Twang"), in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHughes2017206Perone201733-274)[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Caramanica-2021-275) _Speak Now_ draws on rock styles such as [pop rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_rock "Pop rock"), [pop-punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk "Pop-punk"), and 1980s [arena rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_rock "Arena rock").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-NYT-95)[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerone201746,_49-276) Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-277)[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Prodigy-NY-278) and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHughes2017206-279)[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-280)

After the critical debate around _Red_'s eclectic pop, rock, and [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of [Phil Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collins "Phil Collins"), [Annie Lennox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Lennox "Annie Lennox"), [Peter Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel "Peter Gabriel"), and [Madonna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna "Madonna").[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-NPR_Music-281)[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-likeaprayer-282) _1989_, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense [synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer "Synthesizer") and [drum machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machines "Drum machines").[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcNutt202079Gasser2019310-283) Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Levine-284) _Reputation_ consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers-Reputation-159)[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGasser2019310-285) and _Lover_ features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and [folk rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_rock "Folk rock").[[279]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-286) When Swift embraced a pop identity, [rockist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockist "Rockist") critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcNutt202079Sloan202117Stone202360%E2%80%9361-287) but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of [poptimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poptimism "Poptimism").[[281]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-288)[[282]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTESloan202117-289)

Her 2020 alternative albums _Folklore_ and _Evermore_ explore [indie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_music "Indie music") styles of [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock "Indie rock") and [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_folk "Indie folk"), and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with [orchestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration "Orchestration"), synthesizers, and drum pads.[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Sutherland-2021-269)[[283]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Indie_rock-290)[[284]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcGrath202378%E2%80%9379-291) The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric [time signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature "Time signature"), and diverse instruments.[[285]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-292)[[286]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Barna-2020-293) Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[[284]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcGrath202378%E2%80%9379-291) _Midnights_ and _The Tortured Poets Department_ both incorporate a [minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_music "Minimal music"), subdued synth-pop sound, making use of [analog synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizers "Analog synthesizers"), sustained [bass notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_note "Bass note"), and simple drum machine patterns.[[287]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Pitchforkpodcast-294)[[288]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-295)

With continuous musical reinventions,[[289]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFranssen202290-296) Swift was described by _Time_ and the BBC as a musical "chameleon".[[290]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-297)[[291]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-298) [Jody Rosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Rosen "Jody Rosen") commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop".[[292]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Rosen-299) _[Clash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_\(magazine\) "Clash (magazine)")_ wrote that she has the versatility to "no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label".[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-300) According to [Ann Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Powers "Ann Powers"), Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and "reconfiguring" elements of country, R&B, [indie pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop "Indie pop"), and hip hop.[[294]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers-2022-301)[[295]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-302)

Swift possesses a [mezzo-soprano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzo-soprano "Mezzo-soprano") [vocal range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_type "Voice type")[[300]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFulford2014192-307) and a generally soft and breathy [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre "Timbre") that _Rolling Stone_ deemed versatile.[[301]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-308)[[302]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Rolling_Stone-2023-309) Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[[303]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEProvenzano2018173-310) Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_\(music\) "Pitch (music)") with [Auto-Tune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune "Auto-Tune") and how she prioritized "intimacy over power and nuance" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEProvenzano2018173%E2%80%93174-311)—a style that has been described as conversational.[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers1989-312)[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-313) According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow".[[307]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-LAT-314)

On _Red_ and _1989_, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[[308]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerone201746%E2%80%9348-315)[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers1989-312) Her voice on _Reputation_ and _Midnights_ incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-[rap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rap "Rap") delivery which emphasizes rhythm and [cadence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence "Cadence") over melody.[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-316)[[294]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers-2022-301) She uses her lower [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_\(music\) "Register (music)") vocals extensively in "Cardigan"[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-317) and both her lower and upper registers in _Evermore_; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as "breathy and bright" and the lower register as "full and dark".[[286]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Barna-2020-293)

Reviews in _The New York Times_, _Variety_ and _The Atlantic_ were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Caramanica-2021-275)[[311]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-318)[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-319)[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-320) She ranked 102nd on _Rolling Stone_'s 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: "A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like _Folklore_, _Evermore_, and _Midnights_ officially settled the argument."[[302]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Rolling_Stone-2023-309) Laura Snapes of _The Guardian_ said that Swift's "vocal trademarks" include a "yo-yoing vocal yelp" and "climactic, processed _cri de coeur_".[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-321) [Amanda Petrusich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Petrusich "Amanda Petrusich") praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-:2-322)

### Songwriting

Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-323)[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-sessionsinterview-324) She enjoyed [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney "Disney") film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-theaustralian1-325) Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as [Patsy Cline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Cline "Patsy Cline"), [Loretta Lynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Lynn "Loretta Lynn"), [Tammy Wynette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Wynette "Tammy Wynette"), and [Dolly Parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton "Dolly Parton");[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Rolling_Stone_2008-12-08-20)[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-billboard2-104) 1990s songwriters such as [Melissa Etheridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Etheridge "Melissa Etheridge"), [Sarah McLachlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_McLachlan "Sarah McLachlan"), and [Alanis Morissette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanis_Morissette "Alanis Morissette");[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-326) [Joni Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Mitchell "Joni Mitchell");[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-327) and [Fall Out Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Out_Boy "Fall Out Boy").[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Hiatt-2019-328) She listed [Paul McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney "Paul McCartney"), [Bruce Springsteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen "Bruce Springsteen"), [Emmylou Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmylou_Harris "Emmylou Harris"), and [Kris Kristofferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kristofferson "Kris Kristofferson") as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-widdicombe1-29)[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-usatoday1-329) Her literary influences include the authors [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare "William Shakespeare"), [Nathaniel Hawthorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne "Nathaniel Hawthorne"), [F.

In _The New Yorker_ in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-widdicombe1-29) Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-333)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-telltale-30) Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-ZaneLowe-334)[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-335) On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-NYT-95)[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Kelly-2009-336) She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on _Red_,[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-337) and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on _1989_.[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-NPR_Music-281) _Reputation_ was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-338) and _Lover_ detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love".[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-339) Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-340)[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-341) alienation, [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness "Self-awareness"), and tackling vitriol, especially [sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism "Sexism").[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-sessionsinterview-324)[[335]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-342) She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[[336]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-343) [Neil McCormick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_McCormick "Neil McCormick"), the chief music critic of _[The Daily Telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")_, opined that Swift is a "significant vehicle for expressing the inner lives and day-to-day concerns of women of her generation [and younger]".[[337]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-:0-344)

Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[[338]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Knibbs-2019-345)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-widdicombe1-29)[[339]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-346) who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[[340]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-iceberg-347)[[341]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-348)[[342]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-nymag-349) although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[[338]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Knibbs-2019-345) Critics also praised her melodic compositions; _Rolling Stone_ described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for [verse-chorus-bridge architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_structure "Song structure")".[[343]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-rollingstone2-350)[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers1989-312) [NPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR") dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers-Reputation-159) remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures".[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Powers1989-312) Despite the positive reception, _The New Yorker_ stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a [Dylanesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan "Bob Dylan") visionary".[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-widdicombe1-29) [Tabloid media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_media "Tabloid media") often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[[344]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-351)[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-352)[[346]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Zach_Johnson-353) Aside from clues in album [liner notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liner_notes "Liner notes"), Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[[347]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-354)

On her 2020 albums _Folklore_ and _Evermore_, Swift was inspired by [escapism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism "Escapism") and [romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "Romanticism") to explore fictional narratives.[[348]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-musicians_on_musicians-355) She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-ZaneLowe-334) Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[[348]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-musicians_on_musicians-355) According to _[Spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_\(magazine\) "Spin (magazine)")_, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on _Evermore_.[[349]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-356) _[Consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequence_\(publication\) "Consequence (publication)")_ stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".[[350]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Siroky-20212-357)

Swift divides her writing into three types: "[quill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill "Quill") lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "[fountain pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen "Fountain pen") lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter [gel pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_pen "Gel pen") lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[[351]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-358) Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[[352]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-359) Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the [National Music Publishers' Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Music_Publishers%27_Association "National Music Publishers' Association") remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today".[[353]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-360) _[The Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Week "The Week")_ deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[[354]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-361) and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Dailey-2022-204) Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me".[[355]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-362)

Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic [Kitty Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Empire "Kitty Empire") opined in 2024 that Swift is "a profoundly old-fashioned artist", whose songs "tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[[356]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-363) Swift's [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_\(music\) "Bridge (music)") are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[[357]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-364)[[350]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Siroky-20212-357) earning her the title ["Queen of Bridges"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music#S "Honorific nicknames in popular music") from _Time_.[[358]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-365) _[Mojo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_\(magazine\) "Mojo (magazine)")_ dubbed her "a sharp narrator with a gift for the [extended metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_metaphor "Extended metaphor")".[[359]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-366) Academics have variably described her as a [poet laureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet_laureate "Poet laureate"),[[360]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-:72-367) [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"),[[361]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-:202-368) and [bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard "Bard").[[292]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Rosen-299)

Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[[381]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#cite_note-Ordo%C3%B1a-2022-388) She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing.
