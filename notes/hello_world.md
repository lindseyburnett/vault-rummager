# Hello, World ðŸ‘‹

This is a test note for **Vault Rummager**.

Here's an Obsidian-style link: [[Second Brain]]  
Here's a markdown link: [OpenAI](https://openai.com)

## Section: Context

I'm using this to test local parsing and embedding.

Here's what I want to remember:
- The first rule of note-taking: **Write it down**
- The second rule: **Back it up**
- The third rule: Let a bot read it eventually ðŸ¤–

## Screenshot

This is where I pasted a screenshot:

And this is a markdown-style image embed:

## Code Block

print("Hello, Rummager!")
